I call it vibe coding because the goal is to preserve momentum: short feedback
loops, clear intent, and a workspace that feels good to iterate in.

## The core idea

Vibe coding is less about a stack and more about a tempo. When the tooling is
quiet, I can focus on what matters: shaping the idea and shipping the next
small step.

### The signals I look for

- Fast feedback from the UI
- Clean diffs and clear intent
- A comfortable rhythm between thinking and shipping

> "Flow is a feature. Protect it."

## A tiny example

```js
const vibe = ({ idea, loop }) => {
  if (!idea || !loop) return "stuck";
  return `${idea} → ${loop} → ship`;
};

console.log(vibe({ idea: "Neon UI", loop: "fast feedback" }));
```

### What I want to improve next

1. Stronger visual hierarchy
2. More intentional motion
3. Cleaner writing cadence
